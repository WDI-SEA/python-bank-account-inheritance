# Inheritance in Python
Use your knowledge of Python Classes and Python Inheritance to model several
types of bank accounts.

Create your classes in the provided `bank.py` file.

## Exercise: Write Bank Account Classes
Let's practice writing classes and using inheritance by modelling different types
of Bank accounts.

## Part 1: Making the Parent Class

* Create a base **BankAccount** class
  * Bank accounts keep track of their current `balance`
    * the `balance` starts at 0 until a deposit is made
  * Bank accounts are created with a default interest rate of 2%
  * Bank accounts have a `deposit` method
    * the `deposit` method returns the balance of the account after adding the deposited amount.
  * Bank accounts have a `withdraw` method
    * the `withdraw` method returns the balance after the money was successfully withdrawn.
  * Bank accounts return `False` if someone tries to deposit or withdraw a negative amount.
  * Bank accounts have a `accumulate_interest` method that sets the balance equal to the balance plus the balance times the interest rate
    * `accumulate_interest` returns the balance of the account after calculating the accumulated interest

Sample Input:
```python
basic_account = BankAccount()
basic_account.deposit(600)
print("Basic account has ${}".format(basic_account.balance))
basic_account.withdraw(17)
print("Basic account has ${}".format(basic_account.balance))
basic_account.accumulate_interest()
print("Basic account has ${}".format(basic_account.balance))
print()
```

Sample Output:
```
Basic account has $600
Basic account has $583
Basic account has $594.66
```

## Part 2: Making a Child Class Override Parent Class Methods

* Create a **ChildrensAccount** class
  * Children's bank accounts have an interest rate of Zero.
  * Every time `accumulate_interest` is executed on a Child's account the
    account  always gets $10 added to the balance.

Sample Input:
```python
childs_account = ChildrensAccount()
childs_account.deposit(34)
print("Child's account has ${}".format(childs_account.balance))
childs_account.withdraw(17)
print("Child's account has ${}".format(childs_account.balance))
childs_account.accumulate_interest()
print("Child's account has ${}".format(childs_account.balance))
print()
```

Sample Output:
```
Child's account has $34
Child's account has $17
Child's account has $27
```

## Part 3: Making Overdraft Account With New Properties

* Create an **OverdraftAccount** class
  * An overdraft account penalizes customers for trying to draw too much
    money out of their account.
  * Overdraft accounts are created with an `overdraft_penalty` property
    that defaults to $40.
  * Customer's aren't allowed to withdraw more money than they have in their account. If a customer tries to withdraw more than they have then the withdraw method returns `False` and their balance is deducted only by the amount of the `overdraft_penalty`.
  * Overdraft accounts don't accumulate interest if their balance is below zero, but return `False` instead.

Sample Input:
```python
  overdraft_account = OverdraftAccount()
  overdraft_account.deposit(12)
  print("Overdraft account has ${}".format(overdraft_account.balance))
  overdraft_account.withdraw(17)
  print("Overdraft account has ${}".format(overdraft_account.balance))
  overdraft_account.accumulate_interest()
  print("Overdraft account has ${}".format(overdraft_account.balance))
```

Sample Output:
```
Overdraft account has $12
Overdraft account has $-28
Overdraft account has $-28
```
